# Codes for View Vertically: A Hierarchical Network for Trajectory Prediction via Fourier Spectrums

![$V^2$-Net](./vmethod.png)

## Abstract

Understanding and forecasting future trajectories of agents are critical for behavior analysis, robot navigation, autonomous cars, and other related applications.
Previous methods mostly treat trajectory prediction as time sequence generation.
Different from them, this work studies agents' trajectories in a "vertical" view, i.e., modeling and forecasting trajectories from the spectral domain.
Different frequency bands in the trajectory spectrums could hierarchically reflect agents' motion preferences at different scales.
The low-frequency and high-frequency portions could represent their coarse motion trends and fine motion variations, respectively.
Accordingly, we propose a hierarchical network V$^2$-Net, which contains two sub-networks, to hierarchically model and predict agents' trajectories with trajectory spectrums.
The coarse-level keypoints estimation sub-network first predicts the "minimal" spectrums of agents' trajectories on several "key" frequency portions.
Then the fine-level spectrum interpolation sub-network interpolates the spectrums to reconstruct the final predictions.
Experimental results display the competitiveness and superiority of V$^2$-Net on both ETH-UCY benchmark and the Stanford Drone Dataset.

## Requirements

The codes are developed with python 3.9.
Additional packages used are included in the [requirements.txt](../../requirements.txt) file.
We recommend installing the above versions of the python packages in a virtual environment (like the `conda` environment), otherwise there *COULD* be other problems due to the package version conflicts.

Run the following command to install the required packages in your python  environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training On Your Datasets

The `V^2-Net` contains two main sub-networks, the coarse-level keypoints estimation sub-network, and the fine-level spectrum interpolation sub-network.
`V^2-Net` forecast agents' multiple trajectories end-to-end.
Considering that most of the loss function terms used to optimize the model work within one sub-network alone, we divide `V^2-Net` into `V^2-Net-a` and `V^2-Net-b`, and apply gradient descent separately for easier training.
You can train your own `V^2-Net` weights on your datasets by training each of these two sub-networks.
After training, you can still use it as a regular end-to-end model.

### Dataset

Before training `V^2-Net` on your own dataset, you should add your dataset information to the `datasets` directory.

- Dataset Splits File:

  It contains the dataset splits used for training and evaluation.
  For example, you can save the following python `dict` object as the `MyDataset.plist` (Maybe a python package like `biplist` is needed):

  ```python
  my_dataset = {
    'test': ['test_subset1'],
    'train': ['train_subset1', 'train_subset2', 'train_subset3'],
    'val': ['val_subset1', 'val_subset2'],
  }
  ```

- Sub-Dataset File:

  You should edit and put information about all your sub-dataset that you have written into the dataset splits file into the `/datasets/subsets` directory.
  For example, you can save the following python `dict` object as the `test_subset1.plist`:

  ```python
  test_subset1 = {
    'dataset': 'test_subset1',    # name of that sub-dataset
    'dataset_dir': '....',        # root dir for your dataset csv file
    'order': [1, 0],              # x-y order in your csv file
    'paras': [1, 30],             # [your data fps, your video fps]
    'scale': 1,                   # scale when save visualization figs
    'video_path': '....',         # path for the corresponding video file 
  }
  ```

  Besides, all trajectories should be saved in the following `true_pos_.csv` format:

  - Size of the matrix is 4 x numTrajectoryPoints
  - The first row contains all the frame numbers
  - The second row contains all the pedestrian IDs
  - The third row contains all the y-coordinates
  - The fourth row contains all the x-coordinates

### `V^2-Net-a`

It is the coarse-level keypoints estimation sub-network.
To train the `V^2-Net-a`, you can pass the `--model va` argument to run the `main.py`.
You should also specify the temporal keypoint indexes in the predicted period.
For example, when you want to train a model that predicts future 12 frames of trajectories, and you would like to set $N_{key} = 3$ (which is the same as the basic settings in our paper), you can pass the `--key_points 3_7_11` argument when training.
Please note that indexes start with `0`.
You can also try any other keypoints settings or combinations to train and obtain the `V^2-Net-a` that best fits your datasets.
Please refer to section `Args Used` to learn how other args work when training and evaluating.
Note that do not pass any value to `--load` when training, or it will start *evaluating* the loaded model.

For a quick start, you can train the `V^2-Net-a` via the following minimum arguments:

```bash
python main.py --model va --key_points 3_7_11 --test_set MyDataset
```

### `V^2-Net-b`

It is the fine-level spectrum interpolation sub-network.
You can pass the `--model vb` to run the training.
Please note that you should specify the number of temporal keypoints.
For example, you can pass the `--points 3` to train the corresponding sub-network that takes 3 temporal keypoints or their spectrums as the input.
Similar to the above `V^2-Net-a`, you can train the `V^2-Net-b` with the following minimum arguments:

```bash
python main.py --model vb --points 3 --test_set MyDataset
```

## Evaluation

You can use the following command to evaluate the `V^2-Net` performance end-to-end:

```bash
python main.py \
  --model V \
  --loada A_MODEL_PATH \
  --loadb B_MODEL_PATH
```

Where `A_MODEL_PATH` and `B_MODEL_PATH` are the folders of the two sub-networks' weights.

## Pre-Trained Models

We have provided our pre-trained model weights to help you quickly evaluate the `V^2-Net` performance.
Click [here](drive.google.com) to download the zipped weights file.
Please unzip it to the project's root folder.
It contains model weights trained on `ETH-UCY` by the `leave-one-out` stragety, and model weights trained on `SDD` via the dataset split method from SimAug.

```null
REPO_ROOT_DIR
  - weights
    - vertical
      - a_eth
      - a_hotel
      - a_sdd
      - a_univ
      - a_zara1
      - a_zara2
      - b_universal
```

You can start the quick evaluation via the following commands:

```bash
for dataset in eth hotel univ zara1 zara2 sdd
  python main.py \
    --model V \
    --loada ./weights/vertical/a_${dataset} \
    --loadb ./weights/vertical/b_universal
```

## Evaluation of the Usage of Spectrums

We design the minimal vertical model to directly evaluate the metrics improvements brought by the usage of DFT (i.e., the trajectory spectrums).
The minimal V model considers nothing except agents' observed trajectories when forecasting.
You can start a quick training to see how the DFT helps improve the prediction accuracy by changing the argument `--T` between `[none, fft]` via the following scripts:

```bash
for ds in eth hotel univ zara1 zara2
  for T in none fft
    python main.py \
      --model mv \
      --test_set ${ds} \
      --T ${T}
```

You can also [download](drive.google.com) and zip our weights into the `weights/vertical_minimal` folder, then run the following test scripts:

```bash
for name in FFTmv mv
  for ds in eth hotel univ zara1 zara2
    python main.py --load ./weights/vertical_minimal/${name}${ds}
```

Test results will be saved in the `test.log` file.
You can find the following results if everything runs correctly:

```log

```

You can find the considerable ADE and FDE improvements brought by the DFT (or called the trajectory spectrums) in the above logs.
Please note that the prediction performance is quite bad due to the simple structure of the *minimal* model, and it considers nothing about agents' interactions and multimodality.
