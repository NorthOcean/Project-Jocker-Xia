# Project-Jocker

A code repository for 🛠developing🛠 codes for the following projects:

- *Vertical*:
  Codes for "View Vertically: A Hierarchical Network for Trajectory Prediction via Fourier Spectrums".
  Codes are developed in the `Vertical` branch.
- *Silverballers*: Codes for an unnamed trajectory prediction project.
  Codes are developed in the `boundingbox` branch.

**NOTE** that all codes developing here are not the final (release) version, and they COULD have many problems when implementing.
